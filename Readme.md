# Backstage.io

As a learning method we are going to implement the backstage.io in this project

# Development

We need to start some environments, we are using podman, because docker in big environments is not free. But to change from podman to docker, just create a alias in the scripts.

**build the images:**

`sh ./scripts/build-podman-images.sh`

run the images:

`sh ./scripts/run-podman-images.sh`
